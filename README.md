# Essay-sentence-and-spelling-checker
This is an assignment for algoscale.

The dataset used is nltk brown which can be found in nltk corpus.
We can use much larger data set for more result but due to time constraint I used this.

Model used is Logistic regression as similar type of sentence structure need to be found. Rather than checking all the sentence grammer.
